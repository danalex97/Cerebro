# Cerebro

## About

Cerebro is a question based learning tool that promotes peer interactions through competitive academic challenges.
It was developed for the WebApps project at Imperial, in 2017.

## Motivation

* Our ambition is to deliver the best learning quality per time ratio.

* What we intend is to gather all the crucial material into an interactive climate, ”a million books in a game”.

* We merge the concepts behind forums and trivia games into a learning environment playground.

* A central aspect is that users can contribute with their own questions on a topic of their choice.
